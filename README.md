# dga_identification
classification of dga based on sample data collected as csv

*file named 'model.py' (initial model created and accuracy is poor to low)
 creates a model using simple Sequential 'Dense' layers from Keras Toolkit and saves it as json file named 'model.json' with corresponding weights stored in 'model.h5'
'test.py' file loads the json and h5 file of 'model' & tests the model and its accuracy


*file named 'model1.py'
 creates a model using Sequential layers of 'LSTM' using Keras Toolkit and saves s json file named 'model1.json' with corresponding weights stored in 'model1.h5'
 'test1.py' file loads the json and h5 file of 'model1' & tests the model and its accuracy
